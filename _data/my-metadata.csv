","Featuring gothic architecture, brick pathways and green lawns, the Quad is surrounded by six buildings that house the arts, humanities and social sciences. It is the primary gathering place on campus, especially when the Yoshino Cherry trees are in bloom each spring.  Suzzallo Library is named for Henry Suzzallo, president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926. President Suzzallo believed that the library should be the focus of the university, inspiring both mind and spirit. It was designed by architects Bebb and Gould, who were responsible for most of the exemplary collegiate gothic styles on campus. The west wing of the library was built in 1926, and the southeast wing was added in 1935. The Art Building (not shown here) was built in 1949.

Suzzallo Library is named for Henry Suzzallo, president of the University of Washington from 1915 to 1926. President Suzzallo believed that the library should be the focus of the university, inspiring both mind and spirit. It was designed by architects Bebb and Gould, who were responsible for most of the exemplary collegiate gothic styles on campus. The west wing of the library was built in 1926, and the southeast wing was added in 1935. A glass and concrete addition of 125,000 square feet was added to the north and east sides of Suzzallo Library in the years from 1961 to 1963.

The exterior of Suzzallo Library features eighteen terra-cotta figures in niches atop buttresses. These were selected by the UW faculty in 1923 to symbolize contributions to learning and culture. Allan Clark, a young sculptor from Tacoma, was commissioned to create the figures, which include Moses, Louis Pasteur, Dante, Shakespeare, Plato, Benjamin Franklin, Justinian, Sir Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Goethe, Herodotus, Adam Smith, Homer, Gutenberg, Beethoven, Darwin and Grotius.","Suzzallo Library (Seattle, Wash.);

coll005,hedden-2023-the-airplane.pdf,,,The Airplane and the Imperial City: A Brief History of Seattle and American Empire,"Hedden, Andrew",2024-05,"This essay explores airplane manufacturing in twentieth-century Seattle to trace the correspondence between major developmental moments in the city’s history and broader transitional moments in American empire. In doing so, it argues that Seattle is best understood as an imperial city characterized by four ongoing features: extensive connections beyond the city’s nominal borders; sustained alliance between private commercial interests and the state that made such connections possible; a built environment of technological infrastructure made to serve that alliance; and labor forces, segmented by race, subject to the evolving needs of empire.

",2024-04-11,"The film version of “The Boys in the Boat,” released on Dec. 25, was inspired by the University of Washington men’s rowing team that won a gold medal at the 1936 Olympics. It’s based on the 2013 book by Daniel James Brown. But there is more to the story than the improbable victory by UW student-athletes from small towns and working-class backgrounds. Laurie Marhoefer, professor of history at the UW, studies Weimar and Nazi Germany with a focus on queer and trans people.
